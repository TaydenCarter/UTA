# In this Folder are the components of my final project for 1351 Intro to Engineering Design Final Project.
# The code is in the .ino programming language but I will have it as a note for viewing.
# The project was powered by an Arduino Uno R3 with a CNC V3 Shield with 4 A4988 Drivers, 4 Nema 17 Steppers, and 1 SG90 Servo.
# The code was completely unique to this Project and took a lot of research and planning.
